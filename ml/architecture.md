## Overview
Transform manual trend curation into an intelligent, ML-driven prediction system that accumulates data and generates insights automatically.

## ML Pipeline Architecture

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer
**Real-time data collection from multiple sources:**

#### Korean Social Media APIs
- **YouTube Data API v3**
  - Search for Korean coffee content: "한국 카페", "커피 트렌드", "신메뉴"
  - Extract: view counts, upload dates, engagement metrics, video metadata
  - Monitor specific Korean coffee channels and influencers

- **Instagram Basic Display API**
  - Hashtag tracking: #서울카페, #성수동카페, #카페신메뉴, #한국커피
  - Collect: post engagement, image analysis, location data
  - Track Korean cafe accounts and coffee influencers

- **TikTok Content API**
  - Korean coffee trend videos
  - Viral coffee preparation methods
  - Engagement velocity and geographic spread

- **Naver Search Trends API**
  - Korean search volume for coffee terms
  - Rising search queries related to beverages
  - Geographic search distribution within Korea

#### Manual Data Integration
- Admin panel inputs become training data

- search_momentum (search volume growth rate)
- geographic_spread_rate (new cities adopting per week)

# Seasonality patterns
- korean_seasonal_alignment (matches traditional seasonal preferences)
- weather_correlation (hot/cold beverage trends)
- cultural_event_timing (holidays, festivals affecting food trends)
```

#### Social Signal Features
```python
# Content authenticity indicators
- creator_type_distribution (cafe owners vs influencers vs customers)
- content_quality_scores (recipe detail level, production value)
- organic_vs_promotional_ratio

# Network effects
- influencer_adoption_pattern (which tier influencers adopt first)
- cross_platform_consistency (same trend across multiple platforms)
- mention_network_density (how interconnected the mentions are)
```

#### Ingredient & Business Features
```python
# Ingredient intelligence
- ingredient_availability_score (how easy to source in global markets)
- preparation_complexity (equipment and skill requirements)
- cost_accessibility (ingredient and prep costs)

# Market timing
- competition_landscape (similar trends in market)
- seasonal_ingredient_availability
- supply_chain_readiness
```

### 3. ML Models

#### Model 1: Trend Discovery (Classification)
**Purpose**: Automatically identify emerging trends from social media noise
```python
Input Features:
- Social media mention velocity
- Content creator diversity
- Geographic concentration
- Ingredient novelty score
- Historical pattern matching

Output: Binary classification (Is this a genuine trend?)
Confidence Score: 0.0 - 1.0
```

#### Model 2: Success Probability Prediction (Regression)
**Purpose**: Predict likelihood of global adoption
```python
Input Features:
- Korean market adoption rate
- Historical precedent similarity
- Ingredient/preparation barriers
- Social media engagement patterns
- Economic factors (ingredient costs, equipment needs)

Output: Success probability (0-100%)
Business Impact: Expected revenue potential
```

#### Model 3: Trend Stage Classification (Multi-class)
**Purpose**: Classify current trend lifecycle stage
```python
Classes: ['discovery', 'early', 'growth', 'peak', 'decline']

Input Features:
- Growth rate trajectory
- Market saturation indicators
- Content creation volume
- Geographic spread rate

Output: Current stage + confidence
Timeline: Predicted stage transitions
```

#### Model 4: Peak Timing Prediction (Time Series)
**Purpose**: Predict when trend will peak globally
```python
Input Features:
- Korean adoption curve
- Cross-platform momentum
- Historical trend duration patterns
- Market readiness indicators

Output: Peak date prediction (with confidence intervals)
Business Value: Optimal launch timing
```

### 4. Real-time Prediction Pipeline

#### Data Flow
```
Raw Social Data → Feature Engineering → Model Ensemble → Business Intelligence
     ↓                    ↓                   ↓                    ↓
API Responses → Standardized Features → Predictions → Actionable Insights
```

#### Model Ensemble Strategy
- **Voting Classifier**: Combine multiple model predictions
- **Confidence Weighting**: Weight predictions by model confidence
- **Temporal Consistency**: Ensure predictions align with time series patterns
- **Business Logic Layer**: Apply domain expertise rules

### 5. Continuous Learning System

#### Feedback Loops
1. **Manual Corrections**: Admin feedback becomes training data
2. **Business Outcomes**: Track actual trend success/failure
3. **Market Validation**: Global trend adoption confirms predictions
4. **Expert Curation**: Coffee professional input weights model updates

#### Model Retraining
